# Simon Game
Welcome to my Simon Game project! This repository contains a simple yet fun Simon game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and sound effects. Inspired by the classic electronic game of memory skill, this implementation challenges players to keep up with an increasing sequence of lights and sounds.

# Project Features

User-Friendly Interface: A colorful and interactive design that is easy to navigate.
Sound Effects: Each color pad has a unique sound that plays when it is activated.
Increasing Difficulty: As the game progresses, the sequences get faster and more complex.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's current and best scores.

# How to Play
Watch the sequence of colors and sounds played by the game.  
Repeat the sequence by clicking on the color pads in the correct order.  
The sequence will get longer and more complex with each round you successfully complete.  
Try to score as high as you can without making mistakes!
